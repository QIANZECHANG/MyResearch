\section{Background}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------
Japan has long been one of the most popular tourist destinations in Asia. Before the spread of Covid-19, the number of foreign visitors to Japan gradually increased. According to Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) statistics, the number of foreign visitors more than quadrupled between 2012 (8.36 million) and 2019 (31.9 million) that shown in Figure~\ref{fig1}. As a result, the Japan National Tourism Organization has been working hard over the years to assist foreign visitors to have a better experience in Japan. Considering that Japan is a relatively disaster-prone country, disaster prevention for foreign visitors during their stay in Japan has been an issue of great concern to the Japan National Tourism Organization.

Combined with the previous studies which will review in Chapter~\ref{c2}, it is clear that providing information in foreign visitors' native language as well as evacuation assistance is really important during evacuation. Also, there is a need to provide sufficient places for foreign visitors to recharge to ensure that they can contact their family/friends and gather the necessary disaster information from social media/networks survey~\cite{ref50}. Kawasaki (2012)~\cite{ref48} also verified the problems that occurred during evacuation caused by language barriers. Sakurai 2020~\cite{ref46} also mentioned that the Government, as a national agency, should work with communicators to deliver as much information as possible in the event of a disaster and that these guidelines should be posted on social media. The information needs to be multilingual, and the symbols need to be more circulated to help foreign visitors who do not understand Japanese well. Kawasaki (2018)~\cite{ref47} also indicated that foreigners with strong Japanese language skills have similar information-gathering behavior to Japan, but that foreigners who do not know much about Japan rarely use media that focus on the Japanese language. This group also encounters difficulties in evacuation due to language limitations, as they can only rely on a small amount of information that can be provided in their native language for evacuation information search.

Precisely for this reason, the Japan Tourism Agency has constantly been concerned with issues of security and safety in the tourism industry. So, under the supervision of the Japan Tourism Agency, R.C. Solutions, Inc. developed a free application called Safety Tips. Safety Tips can notify foreign visitors of earthquake early warnings, tsunami warnings, eruption alerts, special warnings, heatstroke information, national protection information, evacuation advisories, and other disasters that occurred in Japan. Figure~\ref{fig3} shows the Safety Tips interface.  Based on previous research, this application can largely solve the problems that foreign visitors encounter in the evacuation process due to the language barrier, as Safety Tips can provide a variety of purposes for foreign visitors to Japan. It is available in 14 languages (15 languages), including Japanese, English, Chinese (traditional and simplified), Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Tagalog, Nepali, Khmer, Burmese, and Mongolian (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig4}). Safety Tips is an important part of this study. In order to make Safety Tips better for foreign visitors to utilize during the evacuation, this study will compare the difference in perceptions on Safety Tips among respondents of various nationalities, as well as the differences in perceptions on Safety Tips among people from various upbringing backgrounds. By understanding these differences and how personal backgrounds affect people's perception of Safety Tips, we can use the results to make recommendations that will help Safety Tips develop.

\section{Research Problem Identification}
Based on the above, we can understand that foreign visitors will face numerous challenges when a disaster strikes while visiting. Because earthquakes and other natural disasters are relatively common in Japan, Japanese children learn about evacuation at a young age and participate in numerous evacuation/evacuation drills and exercises. However, there would be many differences between Japanese and foreign visitors. For example, for foreign visitors, it is unknown whether they have previously experienced disasters, whether they learned about evacuation as children, or whether they have participated in earthquake simulation drills. As a result, they would behave differently with the Japanese during the evacuation. 

Therefore, it is important to explore the behavioral differences between foreign visitors and Japanese. In many cases, it is not very helpful to set up disaster prevention programs only according to the behavior of Japanese people. Only when we clearly understand the differences in behavior between Japanese and foreign visitors, and then think about how to help them according to the behavior of foreign visitors, can we better build disaster prevention programs. In order to achieve this, the results of the choice of disaster response behaviors were analyzed in this study to explore evacuation behavior preferred by foreign visitors, as well as the differences between Japanese and foreign visitors.  If this study can identify differences in evacuation behavior between Japanese and foreign visitors, then the findings can be used to improve current disaster relief programs. In other words, assuming that both Japanese and foreign visitors prefer to follow the guidance in evacuation behavior rather than evacuate on their own, then our disaster response program for foreigners could be based on the current disaster response program for Japanese. For example, both Japanese and foreign visitors search for information during the evacuation, but some prefer Face-to-face and some prefer No-face-to-face, so which way of providing information should we focus on when formulating disaster relief programs. For example, do foreigners tend to rely more on embassies, and do Japanese people rely more on the Japanese people around them? Or do both Japanese and foreign visitors prefer to collect information on their cell phones. in addition, there are many choices of disaster response behaviors used in this study, and we can also use these choices to refine their behavior. For example, although Japanese and foreign visitors both prefer to find information through No-face-to-face, is there a difference in the specific way of collecting the information? Is it through the disaster prevention application on cell phones, SNS, or some disaster prevention websites? Such differences have great significance when we develop disaster response programs, which is why this study wanted to focus on this part of the findings.


On the other hand, whether the respondents' perception on Safety Tips is influenced by some demographic information such as country, age, gender, and their past experiences is also a problem that this study wants to explore. It is hoped that this study will help to find out the reasons for the different perceptions of Safety Tips so that Safety Tips can be better developed. This is because if we know which factors help people to have a positive effect on the perception on Safety Tips and which factors have a negative effect on perception on Safety Tips, we can more easily improve Safety Tips. That is, if age has an effect on the perception on Safety Tips, then we know that we can improve the download rate by changing the audience group. In addition, if the results show that a certain age group has a significantly better perception on Safety Tips, then that age group can be our main target group for popularization. In addition, if the results show that the more people know about disasters, the more they positively influence the perception of Safety Tips, we can apply the results to develop Safety Tips. On the contrary, if the results show a negative effect, we should think about why this negative effect is caused, and whether the more knowledge we have, the more we think it does not matter whether we use this disaster prevention application or not. In that case, how should we improve this application? These results will have great significance help when we develop Safety Tips. 

Furthermore, there has a connection between the two issues. If we know the disaster response behaviors of foreign visitors, we can apply these results to Safety Tips. For example, if foreign visitors are used to searching for information and then evacuating themselves, we can provide some self-evacuation guidelines on Safety Tips. Or if foreign visitors feel that it is important to have enough supplies, we can provide a search function for supermarkets/convenience stores on Safety Tips. If Safety Tips can synchronize the geographical information and the availability of nearby supermarkets/convenience stores, it will help foreign visitors more. Therefore, a full understanding of their disaster response behaviors will allow us to better design and develop Safety Tips.

\section{Research Goal and Objective}
The goal of this study is to clarify the information-seeking and evacuation behavior of foreign visitors to Japan, as well as their perception of Safety Tips. This study has three main research objectives. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Objective 1: To understand foreign visitors' perception on Safety Tips.
\item Objective 2: To explore how foreign visitors' perceptions on Safety Tips are influenced by their characteristics.
\item Objective 3: To explore disaster response behaviors of information seeking and evacuation.
\end{itemize}

Finally, based on the findings of the research, this study provides improvement suggestions to Safety Tips.


\section{Thesis Structure} 

This thesis begins with the first chapter, introduction, which explains the study's background, research questions, objectives and goals, and thesis structure. The introduction chapter's purpose is to provide background for the entire study and to help the reader in understanding the research topic. Then, the second chapter of the thesis focuses on the literature review. Considering that in this study, it is necessary to make the basic hypothesizes of Structural Equation Modeling based on prior research, Chapter~\ref{c2} reviews some relevant studies in the field of evacuation research and provide an idea for the basic hypothesizes of relationships between factors like demographic information, educational background, past disaster experience, and disaster training experience. The information of the survey and data used in this study are presented in Chapter~\ref{c3}. Because the data in this study is extensive and complex, we intend to provide a more complete description in Chapter~\ref{c3} to help the reader understand it better. 

To make Safety Tips more useful to foreign visitors, Chapter~\ref{c4} aims to achieve objective 1, which is to understand respondents' perceptions on the use of Safety Tips. Then, Chapter~\ref{c5} is to achieve objective 2, which is to explore whether those characteristics will influence respondents'  perceptions on Safety Tips or not. The characteristics include nationality, age, travel experience, disaster prevention education level, language ability, disaster experience, training experience, disaster prevention consciousness. These are discussed in depth in Chapter~\ref{c5}. Chapter~\ref{c6} is to achieve objective 3, which explores the response behaviors during evacuation. There have two subsections for Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, which are methodology, results, and discussions. The methodology includes the introduction and academic explanation of each method used to achieve each of the research objectives. The results and analysis show and analyze the results one by one since this research is based on the analysis of data to clarify foreign visitors' behaviors and perceptions, then to make suggestions of Safety Tips. The final chapter, Chapter~\ref{c7}, is the conclusion section. This chapter contains a summary conclusion of the whole study, some suggestions based on the results to help Safety Tips for better development, and the limitations in this study.
