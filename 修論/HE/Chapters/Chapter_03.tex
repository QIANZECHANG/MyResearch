\section{Survey Introduction}
This research is based on an internet-based survey of foreign visitors and Japanese who have visited Tokyo, conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute of the Cabinet Office. The sample size is 1800, including 300 people from each country. The research period is from 2019/9/2 to 2019/9/10. The detailed information is shown in Table~\ref{table1}.

Disaster training experience and earthquake experience-related questions are Q6-Q8 shown in Table~\ref{table2item3}. Q6 is about the disaster training experience. For each of the 4 disasters including Q6\_1\_Earthquake, Q6\_2\_Tsunami, Q6\_3\_Typhoon, Q6\_4\_fire, there are 12 detailed experiences, the respondents just need to answer yes or no. Q7 is about the number of disaster training, the difference with Q6 is that Q7 only focuses on the number of times that experienced disaster training. The answer 1 to 4 as one time, 2 to 3 times, 4 to 6 times, over 7 times. This also includes four disaster types, which are Q7\_1\_Earthquake, Q7\_2\_Tsunami, Q7\_3\_Typhoon, Q7\_4\_fire. Q8 is about the severity of experience earthquake, answer 1 to 8 as MMI intensity, 5 or less / intensity 3 or less; MMI intensity 6 / intensity 4; MMI intensity 7 / intensity 5 weak; MMI intensity 8 / intensity 5 strong; MMI intensity 9 / intensity 6 weak; MMI intensity 10 / intensity 6 strong; MMI intensity 11 to 12 / intensity 7; no experience.

Earthquake knowledge and disaster response knowledge are Q9 and Q10, shown in Table~\ref{table2item4}. Q9 contains 6 pieces of knowledge about earthquakes, and respondents are required to answer their awareness of each knowledge. All answers are based on a scale of 0 to 6, meaning don't know anything about it, almost don't know, somewhat unfamiliar, somewhat familiar, know almost about it, know very much.

Respondents' response actions in four scenarios during the Tokyo Metropolitan Earthquake are in Q11-Q14. Finally, Respondents' perceptions on Safety Tips, including respondents' usage experiences as well as their perceptions of Safety Tips are in Q15-Q17, shown in Table~\ref{table2item6}. Q15 is about respondents' awareness, and Q16 is about respondents' usage experience. In Q15, answer 1 to 3 as don't know, only heard the name before, know exactly. If respondents chose 2 or 3, then they go to Q16. If they chose 1, then directly goes to Q17. Q17 includes 4 questions, which are related to trust level, the priority of use, usefulness, the possibility of future use of Safety Tips. All answers are based on a scale of 0 to 6, detailed as not at all applicable, mostly not applicable, somewhat not applicable, somewhat agree, mostly agree, strongly agree.

\section{Scenario description}
In item No.5, all respondents answer their information seeking and evacuation behavior in each of the following scenarios. There are two types of differences between the scenarios, resulting in four different scenarios. The first type of difference is network-related and is divided into 'Telephone/internet is available' and 'Telephone/internet is not available (A temporary power outage occurs)'. The second type of difference is location-related, divided into 'Staying in a tourist attraction' and 'Moving by public transportation'. Thus the 4 scenarios are shown in Table~\ref{table3}.

In order to answer response actions during the disaster, all respondents were requested to watch a simulation video of the 'Tokyo Metropolitan Earthquake'. The video is provided by the Cabinet Office, the survey was translated and distributed in their native languages. The simulation video~\footnote{\url{http://wwwc.cao.go.jp/lib_012/syuto_02.html}} shows an earthquake of magnitude 7.3 that occurred in the southern part of Tokyo, which happened on a winter evening in the year 20xx, and in order to show the damage, the landscape is represented brighter than it actually is. After watching the video, the respondents were requested to select 5 response actions with an order in each of the scenarios.

In the pre-survey, we collected some common evacuation behaviors of foreign visitors and Japanese people. It's worth noting that selections 1-7 are only available in scenarios 1 and 3 because they require a phone/internet connection. Table~\ref{table4} contains a list of all selections as well as a detailed description of each one.
